# TigerFit
## Notes From Kyla:
  Maybe add a new tab so the student can upload their own meals and workout. For now, the app is complete and is functional, yet basic.
## Notes from Shahash Kandel:
  As a Database leader, I put effort on creating entities, attributes and establishing the relationship between them. I came up with objectives to maintain database objects in coordination with my teammates.
## Notes From Opeoluwa Williams:
  I worked closely with my programming lead Kyla Wilson to develop the UI for our application through developing wireframes. We also used a prototyping software called Figma to understand what our final product would look like and gauge how users might react to our UI. Then we implemented this into our TigerFit application.
## Notes from Subash Dhungana
I am a security team leader and I am responsible for maintaining the security aspects of the project. I helped my programming leader to secure the login page and the home page.
