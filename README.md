# TigerFit
## Notes From Kyla:
  Maybe add a new tab so the student can upload their own meals and workout. For now, the app is complete and is functional, yet basic.
  No new changes on my end, just testing the application on my mobile phone and it runs smoothly.
## Notes from Shahash Kandel:
  As a Database leader, I put effort on creating entities, attributes and establishing the relationship between them. I came up with objectives to maintain database objects in coordination with my teammates. The entities were Customer, Meal, and Exercise. There were several attributes for each entity, and there were different relationships between entities. I worked with database software to find paths for storing, organizing, and managing data. I did troubleshooting whenever I had to, kept the databases up to date, and managed database access. I tested the app and ran it on my phone to check whether it was working well or not.
## Notes From Opeoluwa Williams:
  I worked closely with my programming lead Kyla Wilson to develop the UI for our application through developing wireframes. We also used a prototyping software called Figma to understand what our final product would look like and gauge how users might react to our UI. Then we implemented this into our TigerFit application.
## Notes from Subash Dhungana
I am a security team leader and I am responsible for maintaining the security aspects of the project. I helped my programming leader to secure the login page and the home page. We worked for the login page and if the credentials are wrong, then it would suggest so and the user has to go back and attempt to login again.
